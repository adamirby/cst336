                The Relational Database model was first presented by E.F. Codd in 1970. He proposed the idea in a paper titled <em>"A Relational Model 
                of Data for Large Shared Data Banks"</em>. In this paper, E.F. Codd pointed out what was inefficient in the currently popular network
                and hierarchial data models. Codd's relational model focused on set theory and predicate logic to establish a set of relations rules 
                for tables in a relational database. Codd worked for IBM at the time, and they were not initially interested in the relational model.
                Two UC Berkeley researchers, Michael Stonebraker and Eugene Wong, who read Codd's paper decided to conduct more research into the
                relational model and showed that it is efficient and practical.
